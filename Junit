This repo is a knowledge base for Junit and mockito and can be further extended to automatio tests in future - Cucumber

Behaviour testing : 
------------------
This tests are concerned with behaviour, not result. They test whether a certain method is called at a 
certain point with correct parameters. They do not check what output the method produces.

State testing : 
---------------
State testing on the other hand checks for sanity of result, whether the result is valid and correct.
